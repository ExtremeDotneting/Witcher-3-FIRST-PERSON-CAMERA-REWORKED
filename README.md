# FIRST PERSON CAMERA REWORKED - mod for playing The Witcher 3 from the first person

[NEXUS](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6025)

The mod takes into account the errors of the mods [First Person Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/4889/) and [modFirstPerson](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/1862).

Makes control more convenient and fixes some problems, such as displaying swords, crossbows, camera shifts during different actions (for example, attack or sprint), use of the witcher's instinct.

# Installation instructions
1. Unpack the mod archive to the root of the game folder.
2. Add to the file `C: \ Users \ <your user name> \ Documents \ The Witcher 3 \ input.settings` lines from` add_to_inputsettings.txt`, each at the beginning of its category.
3. Use [Script Merger](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/484) if you have other mods installed.
4. Start the game. Go to the mod settings `Settings -> Mods -> Gameplay` and click on the top` ## PRESET_VALUE_DEFAULT`.
5. In the settings, you can also enable first person view in dialogs, but it works with bugs. It's the same with boats.

# Usage

Press the `P` button to turn on / off the mod.

# Used third party mods
- [modInvisibleweapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/3685) - used the code from here to remove swords if they are not in hand (otherwise they will be in the frame).
- [modinvisibleCrossbow](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/735) - makes the crossbow invisible so that it does not climb into the camera when walking.
- [modFirstPersonHorseCamera](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/436/) - the code from here is partially used for riding a horse.
- [modFirstPerson](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/1862) - used only in dialogs.
- [First Person Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/4889/) - the code of this mod helped me figure it out.
